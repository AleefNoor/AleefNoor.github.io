  <br> As you can tell from the pictures above, <b> I LOVE JUNK FOOD.</B>
  <br>  However, I eat healthy everyday and consume junk food in limited amounts.
  <br>  I also <b> LOVE </b> sweets. In fact, I wouldn't mind to marry one.

  <br> In my free time I love to do nothing. I just like to sit and stare into empty space.<br>
   However, if I want to do something, I like to read a book or spend time with friends or family.<br>
   I also like to watch a movie or research something of my interest.
