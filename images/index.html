  My dream is to <b> walk down on Manhattan looking like a strong, fashionable, wealthy, and independent woman. </b><br>
  I used to be interested in writing so, I am enrolled in a writing program at my high school. <br>
  However, recently I found out I don't like to write because it's too much work. I am passionate <br>
  about short poems or stories, but I am not ready to write novels. Before going into writing, I had an <br>
  interest in computer science and I wanted to work for google. I am back to that dream again. <br>
  Due to the dream, I am attending Girls Who Code to refresh my memory in code. So far, I am loving it. <br>
  I am also extremely interested in acting. I was part of my drama club in middle school. I acted and I <br>
  loved the praise I got from it. In high school, during sophomore year, we did Shakespeare plays. These plays <br>
  helped me realize how passionate I was about acting. Due to this, I enrolled for college now drama classes at Queens<br>
  college. I can't wait to get started. So far, I am set on doing a major at computer science and minor in acting. <br>
  I know it will be a challenge, but I am willing to do anything to accomplish my dream.
